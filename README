StonewallActionProtection
=========================

This is a simple plugin to make protecting individual controller actions with Stonewall (http://www.github.com/bokmann/stonewall) easier

You could use a slew of before_filters, or you could use the conventions layed
down by this plugin.

This is meant to be a Rails 3 plugin (that's where I'm testing), but really, it should work under Rails 2 also

Example
=======

In your model, protect with Stonewall, then declare the following actions:

  Class Thing < ActiveRecord::Base
    # skip the boring, normal Stonewall setup here. See Stonewall docs on how to do this.

    s.action :create do |object, user_requesting|
      # fill in your "is this user authorized to create objects" code here. Called for new and create actions.
    end

    s.action :read do |object, user_requesting|
      # fill in your "is the user authorized to read objects" code here. Called for index and show actions.
    end

    s.action :update do |object, user_requesting|
      # fill in your "is the user authorized to update objects" code here. Called for edit and update actions.
    end

    s.action :delete do |object, user_requesting|
      # fill in your "is this user authorized to delete objects" code here. Called for destroy action.
    end
  end

    
In your controller:

  class ThingsController < ApplicationController
    authorizing_resource_method :thing 
    helper_method :thing   # helper_methods are an awesome way to DRY up your code

  protected
    def thing
      @thing ||= Thing.find( params[:id] )
    end

    def things
      @things ||= Thing.all
    end
  end


If your controllers have the plural of your authorizing_resource_method defined,
this will be used for the index (or any other time when no params[:id] is passed). I've
illustrated this method here, with the "things" method.


You can also create aliases to the CRUD stonewall methods:

  class ThingsController < ApplicationController
    authorizing_resource_method :thing
    update_stonewall_map :give_star_rating => :update

  end
